This is an automated Python orderbook that allows you to create and delete orders as on a financial market.
It was created using pandas, datetime and random libraries.
The information needed to complete an order is the following: 

      trader name
      
      timestamp
      
      type (buy/sell)
      
      price
      
      amount
      
      maker (True for a limit order, False for a market order)

You can create your own orderbook using the "exemple" variable as illustrated at the end of the py file.

This is a school project that I am trying to expand into something cooler.
Feel free to provide any recommendation.

PS: Some of the variables are still in french, working on it!
