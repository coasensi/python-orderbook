This is an automated Python orderbook that allows you to create and delete orders as on a financial market.
It was created using pandas, datetime and random libraries.
The information needed to complete an order is the following: 
  trader name
  timestamp
  type (buy/sell)
  price
  amount
  maker (True for a limit order, False for a market order)

You can create your own orderbook using the "exemple" variable as illustrated at the end of the py file.

This is a school project that I am trying to expand into something cooler.
Feel free to provide any recommendation.

PS: Some of the variables are still in french, working on it!
